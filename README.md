I was motivated to develop this open-source project by my cheater friends(:p). We all have some friends who would tell you that they almost reached the destination while they are still at their home, combing their hair, applying face wash etc. At first I wanted to develoop this app to stop their such lies. And then once this app is in a better shape, when people shall be comfortable using this app, release it to google play store. 

This app is still in it's development phase. And there's still some functionalities left to develop. 

In this app, I used AndroidLocationService for getting real time location of a user and uploaded it to Firebase Realtime Database. As I am using Firebase Realtime Database, once a user's location is updated, everyone who is in the same group with him will see his current location instantly.
